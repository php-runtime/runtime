# PHP Runtimes

This repository included different runtimes for the Symfony Runtime component.
It allows you to run your application decoupled from the global state. What that
really means is that your application will not change if you run it with PHP-FPM,
ReactPHP or with Bref.

This is the main repository with all the issues and PRs. It hold many PHP packages
all with hard dependencies to make installation easier. Everything should "just work".
